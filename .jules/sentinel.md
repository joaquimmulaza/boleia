**Vulnerability:** Realtime WebSockets are ephemeral. If a user receives a notification when the app is closed or backgrounded, it is lost forever. This is a severe UX issue for core events (like ride acceptance).
**Learning:** For critical transactional events, Realtime must be paired with a persistent data layer (e.g., a `notifications` table).
**Prevention:** Implement an architectural pattern where the backend (via triggers or explicit inserts) persists the event to a database table. The frontend should fetch unread notifications on mount and subscribe to the table changes via Realtime, ensuring no events are dropped.
